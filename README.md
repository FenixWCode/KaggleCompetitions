# Kaggle Machine Learning Competitions

## 1. Space Titanic 
This is my first time trying a Kaggle Competition after completing the beginner and intermediate Machine Learning Courses.   

The Goal of this Competition is to predict which passengers were transported to another Dimension by a space anomaly.  

I used a RandomForestClassifier to reach a 78% accuracy on the validation data set.
