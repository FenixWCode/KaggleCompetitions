# Kaggle Machine Learning Competition

 
This is my first time trying a Kaggle Competition after completing the beginner and intermediate Machine Learning Courses.   

The Goal of this Competition is to predict which passengers were transported to another Dimension by a space anomaly.  

I use a RandomForestClassifier and reach a 78% accuracy on the validation data set with this approach.
