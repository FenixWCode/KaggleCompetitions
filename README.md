# Kaggle Machine Learning Competition


This is my first time trying a Kaggle Competition after completing the beginner and intermediate Machine Learning Courses.   

I use a RandomForestClassifier to predict which passengers were transported to another Dimension by a space anomaly. 

With this approach I reach a 78% accuracy on the validation data set.
